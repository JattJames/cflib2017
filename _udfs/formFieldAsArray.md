shortDescription: Returns a form field as array, useful for when you have more than one form field with the same name.
tagBased: true
description: |
 When you pass several form or URL variables into ColdFusion with the same name, they end up as a comma separated list. This is commonly done with checkboxes â€“ a user can check as many items as they want, then they will end up in your code all in a single variable. This works fine, until your data contains a comma. This function will return the data as an array to get around that problem. Tested on ColdFusion 8 and 9, probably runs on CF 7 also, maybe even 6.
 
 UPDATE - rewritten to work in CF10. Code is much more simple now.

returnValue: Returns an array.

example: |
 <cfset MyFormFieldAsArray = formFieldAsArray('group_of_checkboxes') />

args:
 - name: fieldName
   desc: Name of the Form or URL field
   req: true
